# shreya's todo!

- [x] gem logic to unlock from generic white dot to colorful triangle
    - [x] first, focus on one melodic line that loops indefinitely
        - [x] maybe make it not-looping at first
    - [x] make the gems cellipses
        - [ ] understand the drawing logic
    - [x] when gem is hit, reveal its color
    - [x] change audio to synth (should this be first?)
- [ ] add helena's ui to switch between training different attacks
    - [ ] this is when you incorporate different melodic lines
- [ ] maybe add a completion % to show how much of the attack you've gotten right so far
<!-- * find attack notes to put in
    * for each type of pokemon, create 4 attack melodies -->
- [ ] score (accuracy) vs training completion (% of gems unlocked) ?
    - [ ] should we avoid mashing?
- [ ] mention feedback to incorporate playing the attack during battle
    - [ ] amount of damage can be proportional to accuracy, harder opps require higher baseline acc ?
- [ ] add lane line
- [ ] add downbeats
- [ ] add end lines
- [ ] maybe consider having a distinction between "metro time" and "melody time" on the lane
- [ ] data structure for song choice so we can switch between them
- [ ] clean up code for readability
