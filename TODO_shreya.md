# shreya's todo!

- [x] gem logic to unlock from generic white dot to colorful triangle
    - [x] first, focus on one melodic line that loops indefinitely
        - [x] maybe make it not-looping at first
    - [x] make the gems cellipses
        - [ ] understand the drawing logic
    - [x] when gem is hit, reveal its color
    - [x] change audio to synth (should this be first?)
* add helena's ui to switch between training different attacks
    * this is when you incorporate different melodic lines
* maybe add a completion % to show how much of the attack you've gotten right so far
* find attack notes to put in
    * for each type of pokemon, create 4 attack melodies
